This Project contains a visualization of Benford's Law. 
I have taken stock market data of Adani enterprises for the year 2022 to compare it with Benford's law graph.

## What is Benford's Law?

Benford's law, also known as the first-digit law, is a statistical principle that states that in many naturally occurring datasets, the first digit of a number is more likely to be small than large. Specifically, the law predicts that the digit 1 will appear as the first digit about 30% of the time, while the digit 9 will appear as the first digit less than 5% of the time.

One interesting application of Benford's law is in fraud detection. If a dataset deviates significantly from the expected distribution of first digits, it may be an indication that the data has been manipulated or fabricated. For example, if a company's financial statements show an unusually high proportion of numbers starting with the digit 9, it could be a red flag for fraudulent activity.
